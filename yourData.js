        "When the steel drums started at Tonguey's wedding, Jay turned to me and said. Chris knows I play percussion right? He was dissapointed for a moment that he wasn't asked to play. The dissapointment turned to laughter as he critcised their timing, song choices and overall ability. When you sent round the link for your wedding \"app\" I had similar feelings. Until remembering that you guys still believe all I do is fix printers. I guess we all have our alternative truths. The two accounts of the night you met have finally triggered some memories about that night and turns out I didnt introduce you. There was no need anyway, you two were always going to find each other. " +
        "Dickie, in your note to me you said you have no idea how we became friends. Not a clue. And well, me neither. I've tried to read back over messages to see how many people you asked before ending up asking me to go to Denmark. Whether it was around then, before, after. Whether it's the Scott version of events or not. It's all a bit of a false dichotomy. I am so lucky to have a friend who cares for me ss much as you do. In some ways you are like the Dad I don't want to disappoint... We\'ve spent Chirstmas together, travelled together, partied together, comforted each other, and when things get difficult we can always just lock our heads together and you'll come out on top." +
        "Hopefully on your honeymoon you can <a href=\"https://www.dji.com/uk/pocket-2\">captcha some moments and evolve from food blogger to world vlogger.</a> Just let Aisha hold the camera as most shots dont look that great from 4.2ft tall" +
         "You said to me once \"You can do little wrong in my eyes other than be dishonest\" and I'm so thankful you keep me true. Yesterday truly was in my top 10 weddings. And don't share this around. It was my number 1. The wedding of someone I truly care about marrying an absolute stunner. So glad Jess and I could be part of just one of the chapters" +
